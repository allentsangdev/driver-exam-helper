# Common Mistakes New Drivers Make

As a new driver, learning to drive can be an exciting and liberating experience. However, it can also be challenging, and mistakes are common. Here are ten common mistakes that new drivers make and some tips on how to avoid them.

1. Not adjusting mirrors properly: One of the most common mistakes new drivers make is not adjusting their mirrors correctly. Properly adjusted mirrors can help prevent blind spots and improve overall visibility. Before driving, take the time to adjust your mirrors to ensure you have the best possible view.

2. Overconfidence: New drivers can sometimes become overconfident in their abilities, leading them to take risks that they shouldn't. Remember to always drive within your limits and stay alert to potential hazards.

3. Failing to signal: Signaling is a critical part of safe driving. Make sure to use your turn signals when changing lanes, turning, or merging, to let other drivers know your intentions.

4. Following too closely: Following too closely, also known as tailgating, is a dangerous habit that can lead to accidents. Always maintain a safe following distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.

5. Not checking blind spots: Blind spots are areas around your vehicle that you can't see in your mirrors. It's essential to check your blind spots before changing lanes or merging to avoid accidents.

6. Speeding: Speeding is a common mistake among new drivers. Remember that speed limits are posted for a reason, and driving too fast can lead to accidents.

7. Distracted driving: Distractions such as texting, eating, or applying makeup can take your focus away from the road and increase the risk of an accident. Always keep your eyes and mind on the road while driving.

8. Failure to yield: Failing to yield the right of way can be dangerous and lead to accidents. Remember to yield to pedestrians, emergency vehicles, and other vehicles when appropriate.

9. Not wearing a seatbelt: Seatbelts are a critical safety feature that can save lives in the event of an accident. Always wear your seatbelt when driving or riding in a vehicle.

10. Driving under the influence: Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is never acceptable and can be deadly. If you plan to drink, make sure to have a designated driver or use a ride-sharing service.

Learning to drive takes time and practice, but avoiding these common mistakes can help you become a safer and more confident driver. Remember to always drive defensively, follow the rules of the road, and prioritize safety.
